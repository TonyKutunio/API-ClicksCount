# Bitly url shorterer and click counter #

Takes URL and converts it to Bitly-URL and then count the amount of click for all time period.

Python3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


To get the result you may also need to mention your current python version.
You can get it by typing in your console:
 ```$ python --version``` You may see something like: Python 3.8.0.
Your version may differ.

So you may have to enter something like:
```python3 main.py (url to be shorten) ```


#### Example: 
```
$ python(or python3) main.py (url to be shorten) 
short link : bit.ly/*******
This link has been cliked : * time(s) 
``` 

#### Project Goals
To make life easier working with url-shortening
